If you're wondering what this is, currently its a pretty simple script to create pretty shitty novels with the OpenAI api. It might go somewhere, it might not. If you want to try it yourself then clone it, create your .env file in the same directory and put a OPENAI_API_KEY=<your open ai key> in it. Then you can run the python script. I recommend using o3 with reasoning set to high for the best results but you could be spending about 5 or 10 dollars per go.
