Just a basic pdf to textbook framework.

Right now this is just a proof of concept but I'm considering turning this into a fastapi server and creating a website for a converter. 

Right now it's text only however I intend on (maybe?) adding an option for image context. However pdf's really mess up images so I don't know.
