Question: What is this?  
Answer: A simple experiment to turn unstructured context such as pdf's or transcripts into textbooks.

Question: What about images?  
Answer: I intend on eventually implementing images however we'll see eventually. I've found that often images in pdf's are really badly structured, I'm thinking about using the whole page of a slide as context, etc, however there is a lot to consider.

Question: What is your goal?  
Answer: I'm considering turning this into a fastapi server to eventually be used in a product, I'm thinking a simple website converter.
